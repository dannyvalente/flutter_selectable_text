# Selectable Text

A widget that allows to display text like the Text widget, while also allowing actions like selecting and copying text.

Because this widget uses the EditableText widget, it does not support RichText nor text spans.

This will work with different text styles and line heights.

## Getting Started

Using the SelectableText widget is simple, just pass in the text:

    SelectableText("my text");
